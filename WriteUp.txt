Part One
Various visualizations and statistics. Skew and correlation are the main stats used.

Part Two

1. 85% of loans were fully paid

2. 2008 G rated loans defaulted the most frequently at 48% default rate

3. See notebook for spreadsheet of all cohorts. Returns vary from low negative single digits to high positive single digits.

Part Three

Given familiarity with the features used in parts 1 and 2, I began with a simple multi-linear regression using those variables. 
I filtered out outliers and bucketed features like revolving balance in order to smooth out the skew present. This initial regression had weak predictive power with an R^2 of 0.60.
I thought that it might make sense to include more variables and attempt a few different variable selection routes. Lasso was unable to top simple linear regression - likely due to the relatively small number of features and multicolinearity.
